# expando text thing 
gotta find a u word at the end, so we can call that `:et;tu:`

## what
it's a little project
- takes in a minimal mardowish file (more stuff to be addeb as needed)
- parses it a litte and you can have inline expanding link things. just add some more explanations and stuff inline
- 

## usage
- import module `import {ettu} from "./ettu.js"`
- call `ettu(el, data)`
